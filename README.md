Hi üëã My name is Jake Shiel
===========================

Aspiring Data Analyst
---------------------

I'm Jake Shiel, a passionate and driven data analyst with a strong foundation in mathematics and a diverse skill set in data analytics, logistics, and operations management. I hold a First-Class degree in Mathematics from Swansea University, where I honed my analytical and problem-solving skills, achieving the prestigious David Pryce award for the best dissertation. My professional journey has taken me from managing complex delivery operations at Amazon to now training to become a Data Analyst. 

### My Journey 
#### Mathematics Graduate to Data Analyst 
With a solid academic background in mathematics, I developed a keen interest in data analytics, which led me to pursue the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. This certification laid the foundation for my data analytics skills, and I further strengthened my technical expertise by completing the JustIT Data Technician Bootcamp. Throughout this journey, I have mastered various data analysis tools and techniques, including Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and R, which I now apply to real-world data to drive meaningful business decisions. 

#### Technical Skills 
Data Analysis & Visualization: Proficient in Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), RStudio, Tableau, and Power BI. I excel in cleaning, mining, and analyzing data to uncover trends and insights, creating rich visualizations that tell a compelling story. 

Database Management: Competent in SQL using BigQuery and MySQL, with experience in creating database connections, developing queries, and designing database schemas. I am familiar with Azure's relational and non-relational database structures. 

Advanced Excel: Expertise in Microsoft Excel, including Pivot Tables, VLOOKUP, and data analysis functions, enabling me to handle complex data operations efficiently. 

Project Management & Operations: My experience at Amazon has equipped me with exceptional project management skills, particularly in logistics and operations management, where I have successfully led teams, optimized processes, and driven performance improvements.

#### Aspiring to Make an Impact
I am committed to continuous professional development and am always eager to learn new technologies and methodologies. My goal is to transition fully into a data analyst role where I can leverage my skills to make data-driven decisions that have a tangible impact on businesses. I am particularly interested in opportunities that allow me to work with experienced professionals and collaborate with like-minded individuals who share my passion for data.
